abstract: "Battery degradation poses a significant challenge for the usage of Lithium-ion
 batteries, making accurate capacity estimation crucial for efficient operation. Data-driven
 approaches hold promise for addressing this task, yet their complex structures often lead to
 overfitting and obscure the decision-making process. The objective of this work is to build a
 robust and interpretable model for capacity estimation. We propose the utilization of a robust
 decision tree-based ensemble model, extremely randomized trees (ERT), to accurately estimate
 battery capacity based on the features extracted from the partial charging curve. The random
 splits in the tree construction process enhance the model’s generalization ability. Given that
 the combination of multiple decision trees reduces interpretability, we further employ SHAP to
 interpret the contributions of each feature to the ERT model's predictions. The effectiveness of
 the proposed method is validated on a large cycling dataset of Lithium-ion batteries."
