abstract: "We propose a multiscale model predictive control (MPC) framework for stationary battery systems that exploits high-fidelity models to trade-off short-term economic incentives provided by energy and frequency regulation (FR) markets and long-term degradation effects. We find that the MPC framework can drastically reduce long-term degradation while properly responding to FR and energy market signals (compared to MPC formulations that use low-fidelity models). Our results also provide evidence that sophisticated battery models can be embedded within closed-loop MPC simulations by using modern nonlinear programming solvers (we provide an efficient and easy-to-use implementation in Julia). We use insights obtained with our simulations to design a low-complexity MPC formulation that matches the behavior obtained with high-fidelity models. This is done by designing a suitable terminal penalty term that implicitly captures long-term degradation. The results suggest that complex degradation behavior can be accounted for in low-complexity MPC formulations by properly designing the cost function. We believe that our proof-of-concept results can be of industrial relevance, as battery vendors are seeking to participate in fast-changing electricity markets while maintaining asset integrity."
